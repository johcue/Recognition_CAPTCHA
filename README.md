# Development of an Algorithm for Optical Recognition and Character Classification in Mathematical CAPTCHA Codes
MATLAB algorithm used to decrypt mathematical CAPTCHAs. Due to the nature of the images, the problems associated with the isolation of each of the symbols included in the mathematical operation were solved with image processing techniques, and the classification was done using the ascii code.

The KNN technique was used for the recognition as it showed the best accuracy compared to the classification models used in the Classification Learner and thus less failure to recognize any CAPTCHA can be guaranteed.
